# Conda dependency submission action

This repository scans Conda environment.yaml files and uploads the results to the dependency graph. While GitHub does not support alerting on OS-level dependencies, it will alert on any PyPI dependencies that are defined in the environment.yaml.

## Treat all Conda packages as Python (optional)

Set `treatAsPython: true` to submit every dependency in Conda manifests as Python (PyPI) packages. This mirrors Dependabot-core Conda beta (Python-focused) behavior.

Notes:

- Names are normalized like Python packages (lowercase, `_` and `.` replaced with `-`).
- Top-level conda deps are reported as `pkg:pypi/...` when enabled.
- The `python` interpreter package is skipped.
- For wildcard/constraint/build-string specs, the purl omits the version.
